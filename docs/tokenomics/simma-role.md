# SIMMA role (v0)

Decision: Option A — Incentives only (not required for swaps)

Rationale:
- Keep IntentSettlement + solver flow simple and shippable.
- Add fees/governance later as modules once liquidity + usage exists.

Planned next additions:
- Incentives controller (LP mining / solver rebates)
- Governance (timelock + token voting) after v0 stability
